# rguthrie's Weather Dashboard

This site is a simple Day Planner for current day only. You can enter your events
as free text for each hour of the workday (8 am to 6 pm). You can save each hour 
so that the events will be there if you leave and come back to the site. The hours
are color-coded to indicate past (gray), present (red), and future (green). 

## Getting Started

This project is hosted on GitHub at https://rguthrie000.github.io/rguthrieDayPlanner/
The HTML, CSS, and JS files are located at repo rguthrie000/rguthrieDayPlanner.  
In addition to script.js, the assets\css folder has reset.css.

### Prerequisites

A web browser is required to interpret/run this program.

### Installing

Copy index.html to the desired execution directory.  Also copy the full assets subdirectory 
to the execution directory.  To run, paste the relative link to index.html in the browser URL box,

## Running the tests

The Day Planner is easily tested by using its GUI to explore performance against
the requirements.
